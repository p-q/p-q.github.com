<p>Mobile phones and laptops being collected by the organisers. – IPhO 2012 <q>’<a href="http://www.ipho2012.ee/students/">Program for student</a></q>’</p>

<p>In addition to that, all competitors had to pass an airport-like security check before entering the contest hall.</p>
<p>I was there. The <q>’security</q>’, originally meant to protect the academic integrity of results, was, of course, useless and also not surprisingly a pain in the ass. Sadly, IPhO 2012 is just an example, the attitude ranted about in this post is far more common.</p>
<p>To let competitors solve tasks in their native language, the leaders were to translate them the night before the examination. Each group of four students from the same country was appointed a guide who was supposed to look after them, keep them in line of sight at all times and make sure they do not communicate with anybody else. Students were separated from team leaders and observers during the second day and accomodated in a different city. The reasoning behind this is to avoid teachers tipping off students about the tasks to come. To the same and, all electronics, even those clearly useless for communicating, were to be confiscated.</p>
<p>This rendered all students dependent on their guides and the organizers in general – in a foreign country without any means to reach their peers. In addition to the obvious discomforts caused to competitors, it amplified several vacancies in the actions of the organizers. There were cases when people went out to jog, smoke, or just to take walk and were looked for by numerous guides thinking how lost one might be. There were legitimate and urgent topics to be discussed between students and their teachers. More than a hundred people spent a night worrying about problems created by other regulations that could have been significantly mitigated by clear communication, possibly with their own teachers.</p>
<p>And what did we actually get out of it? Students were <em>asked</em> to give their electronics away, anyone could have kept a cellphone just by saying that they don’t have one with them. <strong>If one had decided to cheat before the electronics were confiscated, that would have been easy</strong>. In addition to that, some students /did/ talk on the phone to the teachers during the guarantine. In their native language. There was a guide present (the owner of the phone) but the chance of him understanding anything at all of the conversation was negilible. And if inventing an excuse to get to use a guide’s phone would have sounded too difficult, one could just have walked to the shopping centre across the road and asked people for directions to the nearest internet access point. <strong>Contacting the leaders was made less convenient, but not less possible</strong>. If one would have wanted to ask their leader about the tasks, it would have been possible with relatively small effort. Confiscating electronics is useless.</p>
<p>Security checks before entering the examination hall were less disturbing but even easier to prove useless. I did not manage to confirm it first-hand, but the rumor says that one of the organizers themselves took on the security check on his own and sneaked in with an axe, two cellphones and Suspicious Pieces Of Paper. Even if it did not actually happen, there was nothing that could have prevented it. <strong>The only thing keeping students from cheating was their own honesty</strong>.</p>
<p>The experimental examination took part in two groups, because there was not enough equipment for all students at once. While the first group was taking the exam, the second group was confined in a science adventure park. People slept on chairs and floors, studied for the competition and someone even managed to get her hands on some dry ice to play tricks with. Wouldn’t it have been saner and easier to confine those who know the tasks (because they are solving them and therefore already in one room with a good reason to be there) and let those who don’t know have their way?</p>
<p>If somebody wants to cheat, they can. Preventing it may not be impossible, but it most likely isn’t worth it. Just stacking up random <q>’security</q>’ measures only makes everything more complicated, especially for the honest. It should not come as a surprise that people do not like being restrained from communicating with the outside world or having their possessions taken away, even temporarily.</p>
