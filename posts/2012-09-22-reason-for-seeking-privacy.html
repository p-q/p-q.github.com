    <title>Why claim your privacy even if you don't need it</title>

    <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Quite often when I advise people to take their privacy more seriously, they respond that they have nothing to hide and therefore don’t need it. Even though this statement can be valid in some cases, immediate personal need isn’t the main reason to stand up for your privacy. &lt;strong&gt;By protecting your right to privacy, you send a message that it is okay to do so and strengthen the relevant infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; A critical mass of privacy-aware citizens is needed to prevent practices that abolish people’s rights from getting accepted as normal and mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people who do need every bit of privacy they can get. The least controversial examples I can come up with right now are doctors and lawyers. Even more importantly, anyone working with critical infrastructure needs privacy — this is where identity threft could cause most damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for privacy is in my opinion not fundamental, but nevertheless next to inevitable. The point isn’t to keep some details secret, but to prevent the harm that one knowing these details could cause. For example, as many companies (banks, ISP-s, insurers) authenticate their clients over the phone by asking for their (equivelent of) social security numbers, I would prefer to keep mine private to avoid unpleasant surprises. Sadly, this is impossible because the numbers are not considered personal information.&lt;/p&gt;">
